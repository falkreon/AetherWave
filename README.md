# AetherWave

32x Resource Pack for Minecraft. Originally meant to be as vaporwave as possible, it is quickly spiraling out of control. Help

## Building

Once you've cloned the repo, if you have gradle, you can type "gradle build" on the commandline to zip up the pack! If there's enough interest I can include gradlew, but it's a pain to configure gitignore for. I use Gimp primarily for creating this (with a tiny splash of krita when needed), and source files will generally sit next to their corresponding png if available.

## License Notes
This project is [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

Sadly, in this day and age, we need to discuss licenses. This one is intentionally *dead simple*:

* You can't make money off this pack. I don't envision it ever making money, but still, I don't want to see this thing appear on Marketplace without my prior knowledge and approval.

* My name needs to stay in the pack.mcmeta - I don't know why you'd take it off, but there it is. If you've edited the pack, obviously your name can go in there too.

* Don't hide a masterpiece my dudes. If you made something cool out of this, please share it too!
